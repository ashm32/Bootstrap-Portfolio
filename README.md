# Bootstrap-Portfolio
The portfolio creates placeholders for projects i can later upload, and a place for skills I've learnt with room to add progress I've made. I've used a combination of skills we were taught: HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. This page links to other resourses like my GithHub, Resume and Linkedn. I've taken on feedback from my previous challenges and made sure to make more commits and use more comments in my code.
